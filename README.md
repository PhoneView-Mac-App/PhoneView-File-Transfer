PhoneView is a versatile desktop utility that provides full access to the contents of your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. It enables users to browse, extract, and manage files stored on their iOS devices without relying on iTunes or cloud services. The application is designed for both casual and professional users who need direct control over their mobile data.

With PhoneView, you can view and export text messages, photos, videos, music, and app documents. The app also supports wireless connectivity, allowing you to access your device over Wi-Fi after an initial USB setup. You can even use your iOS device as an external disk to store any kind of file.

PhoneView stands out for its simplicity and powerful feature set. It offers a straightforward interface that mirrors the Finder experience, making it easy to drag and drop files between your Mac and iPhone. The tool is regularly updated to support the latest iOS and macOS versions, ensuring compatibility with new devices and operating systems.

Ideal for data migration, legal documentation, media backup, or simply organizing your device storage, PhoneView is a must-have tool for anyone who wants to go beyond the limitations of standard iOS file management.
